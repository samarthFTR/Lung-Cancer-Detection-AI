This project predicts lung cancer severity using machine learning models trained on patient data, including symptoms and lifestyle factors. It involves data preprocessing, one-hot encoding, dimensionality reduction via PCA, and model selection through grid search. The final model achieves high accuracy while minimizing overfitting through stratified splits and tuning.
